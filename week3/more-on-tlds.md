### Types of Top-Level Domains

For reference: IANA maintains a database of all TLDs [here](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db).

1. **Country code TLDs** 
2. **Internationalized country code TLDs**
3. **Generic TLDs**
4. **Infrastucture TLDS** 



Here are all of the TLDs https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db

### The “original” TLDs 

These are the domains created before the introduction of ICANN. They are the oldest of the top-level domains, and while some have retained their original use-cases many are now just taken as sort of given, de facto domains.

#### .com 

**Use Case**: “commercial”–can be used by anyone, sort of through the weirdness of early internet history became the default top-level domain for commercial or personal use.

**Managed By**: Initially managed by Network Solutions, Inc. as a contractor to the U.S. government, it’s now managed by Verisign, Inc.

#### .net 

**Use Case**: “network”–originally intended for distributed networks of computers.

**Managed By**: Verisign, Inc.

####.org

**Use Case**: “organization”–originally intended for non-profit organizations only (and used by many non-profits for this reason), it’s also appropriated by less benevolent initiatives (see [internet.org](http://internet.org/))

**Managed By**: the Public Interest Registry, a domain registrar created by the non-profit organization Internet Society.

####.edu

**Use Case**: “educational”–what’s considered an “educational” means more “institutions of education”. As of 2001 the domain is actually only for United States education institutions accredited by any agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.

**Managed By**: Educause, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting higher education IT initiatives, is responsible for the TLD, although they actually contract out this work to…surprise! Verisign again.

####.gov

**Use Case**: U.S. state and federal agencies

**Managed By**: The General Services Administration contracts out maintenance of this TLD to Verisign.

####.mil

**Use Case**: United States military

**Managed By**: The U.S. Department of Defense
