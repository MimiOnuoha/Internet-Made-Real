| Erin Keating      | Defines post-internet well. "A new wave of post-internet artists are utilizing the web as an artistic platform and are restructuring the internet to become a non-heirarchical, collaborative, inclusive, and interactive spasce to observe and discuss art that transcends physicality."<br /><br /><br />She chose a really good topic, kind of niche but clearly somethign she's passionate about, and she investigated and wrote about it well. This paper is well-researchered and has a strong thesis that it supports well. Written clearly and powerfully.  <br /><br /><br />I'm not sure if it ultimately is true that they are restructuring the internet to become this space, but they're certainly trying.<br /><br /> | The topic was really interesting and a good choice. <br /><br />What she did well was give us good examples from the artists. What I wanted more of was a sort of contextualization of net art and how it engages with the internet as an art piece and also leverages it. | A-/B+         | Overall, Erin performed well in class this semester. She was notably late to a class and her participation in class discussions was at a lower degree than that of some classmates. But the comments she made and homework assignments she did displayed a noteworthy level of engagements with the class material. The topic she chose for her final assignment (about post-internet artists utilizing the web as an artistic platform and restructuring the internet in a non-hierarchical way) was a fresh and interesting survey of a niche but important field, and her final paper was well-researched, and clearly  written. |
| Krista Rannik     | A really rich space for investigation and inquiry, but ultimately she seemed lost in the material and was unable to pull a substantive, productive, or coherent narrative or argument from it. The paper, which was stylistically weak and  meandering in prose, could have benefitted from someone sitting down to just outline the basic thesis of the argument and then the supporting ideas that led to it. Every single | This needs to be more specific. Authoritative states are one thing, but wasn't clear how it was relatd to the internet. | Marginal pass | It is difficult to clearly assess how Krista performed in class this term. In terms of interest, she was unequivocally engaged in class material and discussions throughout the entire course. However, her responses to homework were at a weaker analytical level than that of her classmates. Similarly, her final paper, about the relationship between the Syrian government and control of the internet,  had the potential to delve into a space rich for investigation and inquiry. However, she seemed lost in the material, and was ultimately unable to pull a substantive, productive, or coherent narrative or argument from it. It felt rushed and incomplete, and was stylistically weak and meandering in prose. Her final presentation fared similarly; it lacked specificity  and focus. |
| Phoebe Van Essche | "This was due to President Bush, who was behind a lot of the unrest in the middle east"—> this is a very generalized statement; it needs to be backed up a bit. <br /><br />Also features some phrases, not fully written sentences. Also pasted nearly a page worth of a legal document in the paper, which isn't sufficient for a final essay. <br /><br />Also switches tense, from first to second person. <br /><br /><br />Edward Snowdn wasn't the first to speak about the US spying (page 4 of essay). <br /><br /><br />Seeing some spelling mistakes (like two commas in a row) that suggest a low degree of attention paid to detail. <br /><br /><br />There's a distinction in this essay that needs to be made between corporate and government surveillance. Though the two really do intersect and overlap, they have different apparati informing them and can't be summarily lumped together without at least explanation as to why. <br /><br />Overall, the paper needs a higher level of rigor applied to it. While the subject is good, the dive into it isn't as nuanced or deep as it could be.  <br /> | Good that she brought in background material for the war on terror with the Patriot Act. But she went too heavy on the background and light on the meat of the topic.<br /><br />Started off strong (felt considered and thought out) and then fell out at the tail end. |               | Phoebe performed well in course this term. She was attentive in class discussions, often bringing up noteworthy points and analyses. Unfortunately, her final paper and presentation did not live up to the potential she displayed in class. The paper in particular was hastily written, featured unsupported generalizations and simple grammar errors, and seemed to sidestep areas that needed to be addressed. Ultimately, the paper needed a highler level of rigor applied to it to succeed. |
| Anna Saldinger    | "Because you don't come across the Internet on the street, it seems to leave no trace on the world." A good point, and good starting point for the paper. <br /><br />"The problem is that most data centers are prepared for maximum traffic at all times, which leads to long periods where tremendous amounts of energy are waster." This is a demand of the 21st century, and it's worth considering whether changing this is a technical or cultural need.<br /><br />A strongly-written and concisely argued paper that was both informative and compelling. Gets at the difficulty of the task at hand while simultanesouly highlighting its need.  <br /><br />And a great tie-in of the Julian Oliver reading that we did. Very nicely written paper. | She did a really good job. Put effort into it, had thought through the narative, chose a good topic.<br /><br />She could have given us a tiny bit more—I would have liked to have known the size of the data centers, for instance. | A             | Anna performed tremendously well in class this semester. Not only was she attentive in class and reliable with turning in assignments, but all of her comments and assignments for the class were  insightful and substantive, consistently deepening class discussions. Her final paper, about the data centers and sustainability, was concisely argued, compelling, and informative. The only thing she could have done better would have been to provide more contextualizing information about data centers (their size, for instance). |
| Alice Jennings    | I dislike the use of "your" in this, and there are some little editing mistakes ("it's" instead of "its") <br /><br />I would say that Alice articulated some interesting points in this essay. The best part of this essay is easily the conceptual work that Alice does in tracing the ways in which Tor connects and diverges with mainstream ideas of what democracy looks like. But the work that Alice did in the end was indicative of the work that Alice was doing in class all semester: intelligent, well-measured, constructive, and creative. <br /><br />If I'm being picky, I would have liked for Alice to reach the meat of the argument a little earlier in the paper, as that is the most interesting part. | Coherent, solid topic, presentation is mature and well done. | A             | Alice was a wonderful student in class this semester. It was clear from start to finish that she was completely engaged in the material. She is clearly a sharp thinker, with the potential to deftly combine different lines of thought into compelling products. <br /><br />Alice's final essay highlighted this ability. In it, Alice articulated some interesting points, and did some admierable conceptual work in traving the ways in which Tor connects and diverges with what mainstream ideas of democracy look like. The paper could have been strengthened by reaching the meat of the argument earlier, but overall, the work that Alice did was indicative of her work during the half-term: intelligent, measured, and constructive. |
| Ivett Martinez    | Again with the use of "your"! I don't like this at all. <br /><br />Similar: Latino should be capitalized, no? <br /><br />What Ivett's final does best is trace out the hyperlocal particularities of what increased online connectivity means for one specific group of potentially vulnerable peoples. In doing so, she highlights the give-and-take nature of net access and usage, putting into theoretical practice many of the things that we spoke about in class this term.<br />The weaknesses are that she could have benefitted by expressing more specifically the exact technical channels that she's referring to. Social media is different than just websites is different than mobile access is different than etc etc. . | This presentation suffered in that it was before the paper was due, and before anyone else participated. |               | Ivett did well in the course this semester. She was reliable and insightful in her homework assignments and frequently contributed to class discussions. <br /><br />Her final paper deftly traced out the hyperlocal particularities of what increased online connectivity would mean for one specific group of potentially vulnerable peoples. In doing so, she highlighted the give-and-take nature of net access and usage, putting into theoretical practice many of the things that we spoke about in class this term. She could have benefitted by expressing more specifically the exact technical channels that she was referring to (social media is different than just websites is different than mobile access, etc). But overall, she performed well in the course. |
| Jane Feinsod      | The nice thing that Jane does is make her question intelligible and easy to see from the start, and then to steadily guide us along her process of thinking through and answering these questions. <br /><br />She also has to field some very thorny spaces in this pursuit, and does so elegantly. <br /><br />I think that she does a very valuable and solid effort in this paper. | She provided some good distinctions (for instance in saying that it's other people that you need to worry about when it comes to privacy, which is an important point). Commendable. <br /><br />Could have talked about how money is made. But she brought a number of questions together in a captivating way, so she's done well. | A             | Jane was a positive presence in class this semester. She was engaged and eager to participate in class discussions, offering up substantive contributions. For her final paper, she chose a topic similar to that of several other students (about Tor and the dark web), but she managed to stand out especially through the structure where she made her questions clear and intelligible from the beginning, steadily guided her audience through her path of thinking through and answering those questions, and elegantly navigated thorny conceptual conundrums. Ultimately, she could have added more to her paper by teasing out more specific points, but she provided good distinctions and did a commendable job on both the final and in the class. |
| Julian Rosenbloom | He's actually a good writer, and he asks some questions that are significant, and some that even manage to drill to the heart of many contentious issues. For instance, he brings up the history of infrasturctural overturn, the benefits of anonymity, and so on.   <br /><br />Unfortunately, he also makes many assertions that need to be backed up more. How do we know more young people will have the technical understanding to use the dark web? The future of the internet lies in the hands of those who use it, sure, but recent developments around net neutrality have shown that not to be the case. Where is the accounting for this? Who is the we who take reliability on the internet for granted? And actually, Tor isn't completely anonymous, he could have done more research to see this.  <br /><br />Really good questions, and fine writing, but too many of them, and he doesn't do the hard work of determinig answers or coming up with a way for things to make sense with one another. | Needed to explain a little better to use what was happening in the slides and how they connected. <br /><br />This presentation suffered because lots of other people were interested in the topic and covered it in a much more thorough way. And he didn't go deep enough. | B-/C+         | In term this semester, Julian was on the quieter, side. He was overshadowed by some of his classmates who were more  vocally participative. His final paper on Tor, however, displayed fine writing and brought up interesting and useful questions that were signifiant, managing to drill to the heart of many contentious issues. Many of his assertions needed to be backed up by sources of more data, and ultimately he needed to go deeper: doing more of the difficult work of coming up with a way to attempt a conceptual answer for some of the questions that he sprung. Similarly, his presentation was overshadowed by other students who wrote about similar topics from their paper in a stronger manner, so though his work was fine, it was middle of the pack. |
| Nate              | He's not the strongest writer; there are many grammatical and word choice points that feel a bit clunky. <br />However, the work that he does in teasing out the history of Tor is very good, and the point he makes is one that is extremely significant: Tor's anonymity protects everyone, but everyone includes everyone: hackers, activists, dissenters, and even government officials. <br /><br />I think that we have to just reconcile that the government has been deeply intertwined in everything that's done around this space. <br /><br />He also does a good job in pointing out that anonymity is not guaranteed with Tor, and he strongly plays to his strengths in defining the routes for true anonymity. This feels in line with the paper but a smart detour. | He clearly had researched this to a large degree, as it had a great deal of depth and interest. <br /><br />Was a nice tying together of many of the different topics that we discussed in class over term, while adding to it with his own research as well. Nicely done. | B+/A-         | Nate was a great student to have in the class this term, both because of his enthusiam for the subject as well as for the notable contributions he made to class discussions and assignments. Every remark that he made in class was attuned and useful, furthering and fleshing out the material. His paper, while not the strongest in its written-style, nicely teased out the history of Tor and contained arguments that were significant, well-researched, and well-stated. He clearly did a great deal of research and work to tie together the topics we had discussed over term, and the paper ultimately displayed a level of depth that conveyed this. |
| Bella Wang        | [note that she handed her paper in physically]<br /><br />She has some grammar and word choice missteps. </br><br /</br>It's good that she talks about the relationship between the government and for-profit companies, but I do think that she could have given us a bit more from this; for example, it seems a misstep not to mention Ajit Pai, who was a lawyer for Verizon and now is chairman of the FCC. <br /><br />I think this could have been just a bit more focused, right now it jumps around stories and anecdotes and I think it could have benefitted from editing. <br /><br />Bella does the thing here that a lot of people have done, where they jump around, conflate topics. While the paper includes some solid material, it feels very loose and ungrounded. | The visuals on her presentation were super strong, it was one of the more put together ones. <br /><br />What she was missing was more specificality, more focus. She didn't define what freedom on the internet is, or what she thinks it is. And didn't get into the underlying factors behind some of the things she mentions. | B+            | Bella performed well in course this term.  She attended all classes, and though she was quiet at times, when she did speak she offered up substantive thoughts, comments, or critiques. She added her own creative twist to the assignments, often displaying a strong visual sense in addition. <br /><br />Her final paper covered rich ground in its comparison of privacy online for different countries. She presented solid material, though it would have benefitted from more specifically and focus so as to present a tighter, more grounded argument. |
| Martin            | N/A                                      | His presentation was on internet cables. But he didn't go any deeper than what we covered in class, which made it feel like it was thrown together at the last minute with little effort. <br /><br />In addition, the presentation could have been stronger—less reading, plus more content. | C+/B-         | Martin seemed relatively engaged in class this term. His contributions, though few, were solid additions to  class discussions. Unfortunately, His final presentation seemed thrown together at the last minute, and thus neglected to pull in content that extended substantially beyond that which we had already touched on in class. Similarly, his final paper needed a deeper level of research and higher level of rigor applied to it. |
| Emily H           |                                          | Consistent deisgn, good explanation, goo presentation. She went more in depth than we did in class, which is a good demonstration of inititative. <br /><br />I think going into Tuvali was a smart idea, we could have just had the whole pres on Tuvali | B+(?)         | Emily is a smart student and capable thinker, as evidenced by her homework assignments and general performance throughout the class. Her final presentation, which she went into depth into top-level domains, displayed smart initiative, consistent design and grounded explanations. Based on this presentation,  I am confident that Emily did write an interesting final paper. Unfortunately, for whatever reason I did not receive a submission from her; as such, I have no other option but to reluctantly grant her a marginal pass. |
| Gabriela Yadegari | Paper is good in that it very neatly lays out the reasons why Bennington would be a good place to begin this sort of project, and ties it to larger conversations as well as to other similar rural community-based internet access projects.<br /><br />The only thing I would have liked to see a bit more is some practicalities: what are the challenges of doing this? What will it be like to implement this? Just saying it might work is one thing, but that's totally different than doing it, or than being the one to write a guide that could direct future people how to do it. This is the | Presentation was fantastic, was really the best connection to the thins that we've done in class but grounding them in stuff happening outside of class as well. <br /><br />They did a great job, and also had a very nice setup that was grounded well for us. | A-            | Gabriela was a good student in the course this term. She was clearly passionate about many of the topics, and one of the students of the class who was quickest to speak up, eagerly teasing together interesting points.  She was late with a number of homework assignments, but did well when she applied herself. This especially showed in her final paper, where she very neatly laid out the reasons why Bennington would be a good place to begin a local self-made internet project. The paper could have benefitted fro ma bit more in terms of practicalities (what would be the challenges, what would implementation look like, etc), but in her paper and subsequent presentation she displayed wonderful initiative and did a great job of connecting the work we did in class with real-world things happening outside of the campus. I highly encourage her to continue pursuing these lines of thought, and this project in particular. |
