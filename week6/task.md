### To start:

Download [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/). Figure out what it is and how to use it. 

### Your task:

Create your own peer-to-peer social network. Each person in the class must create their own profile page (it is up to all of you to decide what a profile page should look like/contain on your social network.) From any one person’s page you should be able to figure out how to navigate to anyone else’s page.
