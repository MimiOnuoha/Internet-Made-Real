# Examples of Alternatives 

Useful (simplified) definitions are provided for you below: 

*Client/Server Model* - The current architecture on the web. Every node on the network has a defined role of either the client or the server. Servers hold higher importance, because they hold data and resources that clients request. The web uses this model. 

*Peer-to-Peer Network* - Every node shares its files equally with the other nodes, and all communicate in a decentralized manner (there is no central server).  FireChat (below) is an example of this.
