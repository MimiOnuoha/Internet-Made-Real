**The Internet: **a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the same protocol and standards.

******The web**: a way of accessing information over the internet (we use HTTP to transmit information to be accessed through browsers)

ARPANET 



Three things that set the stage for the development of the Internet:

1. Existing technological infrastructure
2. Political and cultural climate
3. Emerging technical capabilities 



**Things to consider**

- when does the Internet change to force users into consumers? 
- when does the Internet move from a form of communication to a form of advertising?
  - can you trace this for every mass media form?
- when are people's autonomy less recognized 
- code/programming divorced from corporate needs (why is that so rare?)
- what does the future look like? can we even predict what will be 
- how does the military play a role in the internet today 
- who manages the internet?  



**Class Notes**

- It's easier to draw than to use words when it comes to something as abstract as the Internet

- What would it look like to actually draw/ map out the Internet

- What would it look like to print out all the data that comprises the internet

- Easy to know what to do, but there's always a nother lvel of specificity 

- Like trying to conceptualize or draw the universe 

- Easier to not try and be abstract 

- Is the Internet infrastructure or is it the data that's on it? Can we distinguish the two?

- If the infrastructure exists but there's no data on it, is it a network? 

- points connected by lines | connection and communication

- can you quantify the internet?

- can paper be seen as a form of the internet? becaause it formerly was a source of communication and expression

- can you have an internet with only one node? 

- why is the internet censored in many places?
