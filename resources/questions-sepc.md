# Questions for SEPC Discussion

*Keep in mind that these questions are more for future iterations of the class than for our current session.* 

1. Do you think this class would be better served as a 14-week course? Keep in mind that were it to be 14 weeks, more time would be devoted to individual aspects of the internet and to problem-solving around alternate approaches to the internet that we have inherited. 





2. Our readings tend to be rich, but short relative to other Media Studies classes. Do you think that it would benefit to class to have more + longer readings? Also discuss the ideal amount of time that you think should be devoted to talking about/discussing readings in class. 







3. In its current form, this course involves aspects of traditional media studies courses (in terms of relying upon readings, discussions, and written weekly responses). In a different form, it could also be a visual arts class, and incorporate more projects and interventions (similar to the one that you did in week two). Do you think that it's better served as one or the other, or a hybrid of the two? 







4. So far, the majority of class assignments have been individual. Do you have any interest in working collaboratively as a group on projects? 





5. We only had seven weeks for this class. Were it longer, what other internet-related topics would you have liked to cover?
