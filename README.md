## Course Description

The Internet as we know it today is the mediating point for a multitude of ways that we visually communicate with one another. It is also a massive network of networks that was initially funded by the military, built atop older forms of communication, and owes its origins to sources whose traces have been virtually erased from modern experiences of it. 

How has the the net changed our ways of thinking about visual culture, media objects, and information consumption? What does it mean for such a widely-used medium to have so much of its inner workings concealed? 

This two credit, seven-week course takes off from the starting place of "Media Archaeology: Signs and Representation" but uses the Internet as a window for considering current, global, physical and digital modes of communication, documentation, and exchange. By examining the less obvious aspects of this vast network that governs so much of our lives, we aim to understand how our individual experiences of this system can be situated within a vaster history and reality. 

## Expectations and Requirements

- Class attendance and punctuality
- Participation during class discussions and presentations
- Weekly readings and bi-weekly responses 
- Final paper/project 

This class is an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you have an academic accommodation.  

All students are allowed one absence as a maximum. It is very much to your advantage to not miss any classes, if possible. 

## Evaluation

Final evaluation will be based on class participation, the completion of all assignments, quality of work, and attendance. 

For the final project/paper, I am interested in your ability to engage deeply with the content we have discussed, synthesize material that we have discussed in class, and propose interesting and original ideas and extensions of the topics. 

## Format

The majority of assignments for this course will consist of readings (good ones!), videos, and various thought exercises. During class we will have a number of discussions, as well as activities that will allow us to interface with the material in ways beyond just conversation. 

There is no need to purchase a book, as all readings will be made available to you. 

I can be reached via email at all times, but I am very slow to respond to emails sent over the weekend. If you are in need of a prompt response, please email during the week. I usually reserve 24 hours to respond, but nearly always reply much sooner. 

## Syllabus

**Week One: October 24**    
*The Internet: History and Origins*

[Introductions to course, logistics, and each other] 

*Assignment:*  

- Read the following (short) pieces:
  - Neil Postman - [Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/188/materials/postman.pdf)
  - [The Living Internet](https://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_summary.htm) (One page summary of internet history)
  - [Packet Switching Definition](http://www.linfo.org/packet_switching.html) 
  - [The Internet: changing the way we communicate](https://web.archive.org/web/20060702010235/http://www.nsf.gov:80/about/history/nsf0050/pdf/internet.pdf) (2006 document by the National Science Foundation)
- Write a 200-300 word response to any of the concepts that you read about or that we talked about in class. How is your understanding of the Internet different than before we walked in? What aspects are you still confused about? What do you want to know more about? What things do you feel like you know better? Use the homework form (see top of syllabus) to turn in your response. 

Note: if you liked the clip we watched in class, find the rest of the documentary [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6sk77shbw2zdm9b/lo_and_behold.mp4?dl=0). 

**Week Two: October 31**  
*Net Infrastructure and Traces*  

*Assignment:*  

- Read the following:
  - Julian Oliver - [Stealth Infrastructure](http://rhizome.org/editorial/2014/may/20/stealth-infrastructure/)  
  - To prepare yourself for next week: [how DNS works](https://howdns.works/) 
  - And if you have time: check out Google's [wifi balloon project](https://x.company/loon/) (There's not Google branding on this, but rest assured that it's essentially a Google initiative)

- In class this week, we talked about the physical internet, and the objects and infrastructure that make it up. For your assignment, you must find a way to show the Bennington community what some aspect of the physical internet at Bennington looks like. You can create a diagram, write a document, make a map, stage a brief intervention, or whatever else you want. Whatever you do, make sure that you document it and send me a link (using the homework form!) that also includes why you decided to do this.

  ​

And this is *not* homework, but if you are bored and looking for something to watch this week, may I suggest Anil Dash's 2016 Eyeo talk, titled  [I Am Transformed](https://vimeo.com/175846582). 

**Week Three: November 7***      
*DNS + TLDs*

In lieu of class this week, I want you to focus on being conceptually prepared for the discussions we'll have the  next time we meet—we'll shift from talking about how the internet technically works to how it's run, and what that means. More specifically: we'll talk about top level domains and the politics of governance and ruling bodies in relation to the internet. We'll also begin to question whether the internet is as decentralized as it was initially designed to be. 

*Assignment:*

Here are the following things that you'll need to read/view:

- Check out all of the possible domains [here](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db) (there are some weird ones...)
- Read Peter Yu's [The Neverending CCTLD Story](http://home.uchicago.edu/mferzige/ccTLDs.pdf) 
- Read about [Algorithmic Citizenship](http://citizen-ex.com/citizenship) 
- Watch *[From yu to me](https://vimeo.com/95833310)*, which details how the specifics of one country's internet TLD 
  - Send me a 300-500 word response on any of these three things. Do you buy the concept of algorithmic citizenship? What stands out to you about it? What are your thoughts on the power structures that TLDs mask? 

When we next meet, we'll also talk about your homework assignment from last week. Looking forward! 

**Week Four: November 21**  

*IP Addresses, DNS,  Algorithmic Citizenship*

*Assignment*:

- Read all of the sections of [Mozilla's Internet Health Report](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/).
- Read *[Defining the Web](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/Defining%20the%20Web.pdf)* (Nissenbaum and Introna, 2000 )
  - Write a response to either the Mozilla article or the Nissenbaum/Introna article. Send it using the homework form (see above for link)
    - If you're responding to the Mozilla piece: make sure to address the following in addition to your thoughts: do you agree with the premise of a "healthy" internet? Should Mozilla to be leading such a discussion? Which of thse stood out to you the most, and why? 
    - If responding to *Defining the Web*, be sure to address the following in addition to your thoughts: note that this article is 17 years old (!). It describes a specific moment in the formation of the web. Do the points and critiques that the authors are making hold up today? Is search as political a concept today as they think it is? 
- Bring to class the things you made about the Internet as part of your week 2 assignment.

**Week Five: November 28 **

We will talk in class today about the final project/paper.
